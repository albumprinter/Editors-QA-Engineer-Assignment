Generally I would like to speak with the PO about the product, with the Team about technology and then before everything
we should describe scope and out-of-scope of automation.

During this task i discovered bellow activities to be done.

INCREASE REGRESSION COVERAGE:
UI
1. Cover critical functionalities - related with MVP for current project stage , where all functionalities should be
 working and stable to deliver value:
- registration and login flow
- payment flow - needs further investigation and analysis
- editing flow ( in iterations, this part requires additional functionalities mapping to describe more detialed view)
- Customer Service
2. MVP - 1 happy path including selling per one product ( book, cards etc. )
3. User Profile:
- Settings - editing
- Saved Projects
- Online PhotoBooks
- FAQs
- Orders ( may require further functionalities mapping and exploration )
4. Blog
5. Cover more edge cases and other functionalities of products
LOAD - if it is not done yet, then it is huge risk to not do it ASAP
it requires to perform load tests on the backend side
- evaluate available technology
- create a POC of evaluated tech
- start analysing backend metrics ( observability ) and based on findings design covering load scenarios
- extend load scenarios if needed
SECURITY
the minimum is:
1. Static Analysis
2. Dynamic analysis
SAST sometimes can be done through the config of CI/CD ( f.ex. gitlab ci scanners )
may require evaluation of new technology ( f.ex.: Sonar Cloud , Snyk )

IMPROVEMENTS
1. critical improvements :
- create user creation factory , common for all test cases with proper environment config - trough API
( including countries grouping, permissions, feature flags etc. )
2. implement configuration allowing for multi-country testing ( common scenarios, country dedicated etc. )
3. Observability - start observing the test runs , cycles to spot any trends ( flaky, short, longest etc. ):
- may require to evaluate dedicated technology ( f.ex.: allure )
